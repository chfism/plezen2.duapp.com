        Iron baby L--bits of sunlight running across skin. Arrival  in high morning. That contrast, now, is a thing to hold onto. How I am always  slipping into just holding on. Blood without iron--but I am it, now, sunlight  running across my skin. Salt crystals clinging to my hair. How L, now, is snow. <br>
        I am always slipping into a color world. Roots of cloth and  adaptability. I do not know what world L inhabits. I do not know if L inhabits  at all. I do not know what L stands for. In high morning, I do not know L's  thoughts. If L think of birds? If L  thinks of iron? If L thinks of grass or history? Family? <br>
        On Saturday L sings on our porch--shouts &quot;I will find it.&quot; L  sings a song from our childhood, and I think of a thin, glass box. By four  o'clock it is dark.<br>
        L is approaching 6,205 days in this particular world. What  will L think about in January? Snow? Iron? Will L think about this curving path  that both of us follow? If I think of L--which I do--will L know?<br>

        We  exist on fragments of fall--intersecting at strange and unexpected moments. The  reds and golds of our season remain elevated. Through winters, they continue to  exist on a separate plane. At times I worry that this plane does not exist--that  you are as thin as lace and lost to me. That fall will not last long enough. But  let us speak of light. The quality of light, the color of birds, the tension on  the kite string. Yes, let us speak of winter. Let us taste the pumpkins--smashed  and rotting--floating in the water. Let us--stand alone in time and space,  cutting narrow paths through the grass. This was texture of our hands last  October, sticky and sweet, emerging from the bellies of fruit. That night, I  watched you carve fire--such fire!--every word a sunflower. Let us speak of  years. And when we hear birds, let us ascend.

    <h2>Lives of the Floating Head</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 0px;">
        All day I have been recording the failures of my  body, hobbled as it is by corrosive longings, inadequate rain gear, its obtuse  and variant hungers
        resembling nothing so much as the inedible parts of a  chainsaw the way all I am not drunk enough to say resembles the unctuous
        whatnot glommed beneath the ocean's colossal shadow. I don't believe in karma. At certain altitudes the planet's  unregistered whatnot
        blurs the way anyone, in a certain cast, can resemble Toni  Braxton after a hard night. Like you,  I've dreamed intermittently of the clean life:
        decorative livestock dotting  immaculate town greens, organic T-shirted toddlers and everywhere that brown  artisanal bread, uniformly barnacled
        with oats. By this time next year, I could be the wife of a hirsute fence  mender-cum- hobbyist trapper, washing out his suet-coated Carhaarts seven
        days  a week whilst fashioning commemorative Puffy Paint sweatshirts at my kitchen  table, ergonomically ensconced in a double-wide. As with anything
        else, a pattern  emerges: land, water, water, land, the  moon like a scraped knuckle, a greasy light over everything. In the cache of seemingly wack
        ideas, what  they call an escape fire can keep the bigger one out. If grief had a punch line, it would be, The  Eighties Called, They Want Their
        Haircut Back. Like you, I have been besieged  by fears of the monstrous Not-Yet-Happening like bread dough sealed in
        a bag,  of whiplash, pleurisy, snapping hip syndrome, fare evasion procedures, random  hobbyist newsletter fires, the venomous licks of foreign toads,
        have felt as  flightless bird on denuded horizon, uniformly treeless and shivering. If the unspoken allegiance between two  fixed points is the
        difference between &quot;missing&quot; and &quot;wanting  back&quot; I am always at least three places at once: &quot;passing&quot; and &quot;passing
        through.&quot; The moon retreats from the earth at a rate of 1.5 inches a  year. Kinetically speaking, we are all  moving in reverse. I cannot abide
        someone kicking the back of my chair. According to agrarian folklore, the total  lunar eclipse, like most notable things, can move mountains or make
        you go  blind. Like the retraction and hemorrhage of light there only two ways of being  together: sweatily naked and otherwise.  If you asked, I'd
        abscond with you to the exurbs tonight. Other conflations abound: ketchup with catsup, Survivor Guilt with  Stockholm Syndrome, Prince with The
        Artist Formerly Known as Prince, known once  again as Prince. I can't go anywhere without a layer of wax on my lips. In second grade, Hunter Carlton
        brought a cardboard  box to school. When the teacher asked  what said box was for, Hunter said it was for making love in. Although virgin births are
        characteristic of  the crayfish, the honeybee, and the Komodo dragon, the messianic zombie  resurrection (He is risen, and man, is He pissed) is
        particular to our kind  alone. Looking back, what comes clear  does so through the myopic and night-visioned, the perpetually gummed-up,
        barely-habitable and boggy, spring unfastening through the half-dredged  marsh. If standing water had a theme  song, it would be, I Never Meant to
        Hurt Nobody. And as I keep telling you it’s the workable  equations I like, the coffee strong, dark, not marked-up the wazoo.

        Oxblood-colored bank where we uprooted <br>

        stones to harden. Shoes soaked in silt, we swelled,  <br><br>

        a hunger heavy as a field of florets, feathers <br>
