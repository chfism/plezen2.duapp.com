            <p><strong>What is Yuri’s Night?</strong></p>

            <p>Yuri’s Night is a global celebration of humanity’s past, present, and future in space. Yuri’s Night
                parties and events are held around the world every April in commemoration of April 12, 1961, the day of
                cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin’s first manned spaceflight, and April 12, 1981, the inaugural launch of NASA’s
                Space Shuttle.</p>

            <p>Yuri’s Night events combine space-themed partying with education and outreach. These events can range
                from an all-night mix of techno and technology at a NASA Center, to a movie showing and stargazing at
                your local college, to a gathering of friends at a bar or barbecue.</p>

            <p>In 2011, the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight, over 100,000 people attended 567
                officially-recognized events in 75 countries on all 7 continents, while tens of thousands more watched
                the 12-hour live Yuri’s Night Global Webcast and participated online in the virtual world of Second
                Life.</p>

            <p>Human spaceflight became a reality 50 years ago with the launch of a bell-shaped capsule called “Vostok
                1” on April 12th, 1961. The capsule was carrying Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who took his place in
                history as the first human to leave the bounds of Earth and enter outer space.</p>

            <p>Exactly 20 years later (April 12th, 1981), the United States embarked on a new era in spaceflight with
                the inaugural launch of a new type of spaceship — the Space Shuttle. Designed to carry a larger crew and
                large volumes of cargo to orbit, the Space Shuttles became synonymous with human spaceflight for an
                entirely new generation of young people.</p>

            <p>When the next 20-year point arrived, that generation laid a new space milestone by connecting thousands
                of people around the world to celebrate and honor the past, while building a stairway to the future.
                That event was Yuri’s Night, and it continues to bring the excitement, passion and promise of space
                travel closer to people of all ages, nationalities and backgrounds.</p>

            <p><strong>April 12, 1961: Vostok 1</strong></p>

            <p>On Wednesday, April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin blasted off the launch pad in Baikonur at 9:08 AM local time.
                His call-sign for the flight was “Cedar.” Sergei Korolev, the Program’s Chief Designer, would call from
                the ground, “‘Dawn’ calling ‘Cedar.’” Gagarin made his historic 108-minute flight (orbiting around the
                whole Earth once) and parachute landed near his Vostok 1 capsule in the plains of Russia. This flight
                made him the first human to orbit the Earth and an international hero. Yuri was only 27 years old.</p>

            <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4327" title="yn61" alt="" src="img/yn61.jpg" width="300"
                    height="212"/></p>

            <p>Seven years after his flight, on March 27, 1968, Yuri was piloting a MiG-15 when he got into a tragic
                crash that ended his life. He was 34. It is said that that is why John Glenn was not allowed to fly
                again for so long – to protect him. Yuri is survived by his wife Valentina and his two daughters,
                Lenochka and Galochka.</p>

            <p>The cosmonaut program is rich with traditions that honor Yuri’s first flight. It is customary to visit
                the Gagarin Memorial before your mission, to sign the log book in Yuri’s unchanged office, and to
                urinate on the tire of the bus that brings you to the launch pad (mostly because Yuri had to himself
                right before his flight). We hope the world will celebrate April 12 together and create new traditions
                of space and unity.</p>

            <p><strong>April 12, 1981: STS-1</strong></p>

            <p>As if by cosmic coincidence (the launch had to be slipped two days to fix a computer glitch), the US
                Space Shuttle’s maiden voyage fell on April 12th, 1981, exactly 20 years later. The ship was <em>Columbia</em>,
                and her crew for STS-1 (Space Transportation System, flight 1) was Commander John Young and Pilot Bob
                Crippen.</p>

            <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4330" title="yn81" alt="" src="img/yn81.jpg" width="300" height="252"/></p>

            <p>The flight lasted two days and then <em>Columbia</em> returned for a glorious landing at Southern
                California’s Edwards Air Force Base, giving the world its first reusable spacecraft, a ship that would
                later be used to take astronauts, cosmonauts, and equipment to the Russian space station <em>Mir</em> in
                an amazing demonstration of complementary space assets and international cooperation.</p>

            <p>For over 30 years, the Shuttle program was a cornerstone of manned spaceflight. 5 orbiters, 3 of which
                (<em>Discovery</em>, <em>Atlantis</em> and <em>Endeavour</em>) were still active at the program’s end in
                2011, flew 135 missions to the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, and other
                Earth-orbit destinations. Although the Shuttles have been grounded to make way for the next generation
                of orbital vehicles, their impact on the future of humanity in space will not soon be forgotten.</p>

            <p><strong>April 12, 2001: Launch of Yuri’s Night</strong></p>

            <p>After being just an idea for four years, Yuri’s Night, the World Space Party, sprang into existence at
                the United Nations’ Space Generation Advisory Council Conference in Graz, Austria, during September
                2000. Trish Garner, George Whitesides, and Loretta Hidalgo announced the kickoff of the event and
                released the first version of our website.</p>

            <p>Seven months later, they had a buzzing team of space activists and party planners in Los Angeles and 64
                events around the world. Our global space community was ready to spring into action to make a
                difference.</p>

            <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4332" title="yn01" alt="" src="img/yn01.jpg" width="300"
                    height="154"/></p>

            <p>Felipe Hernandez (or Astrolipe), a DJ/space architect from Chile, was interviewed by CNN en Español,
                Loretta was on the KNBC local news live in the studio, Chris Welch was on BBC Radio, and George was on
                both NPR’s <em>Morning Edition</em> and MTV’s <em>Mandy Moore Summer Special</em> – where he was
                highlighted as a good guy for his efforts to bring the planet together to dance for space.</p>

            <p>The parties were all extraordinary. In Yuri’s Night Mission Control, we had a countdown to the first
                party in Sydney, and then they just continued to roll around the planet. Melbourne had a posh affair
                with space cocktails; the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station did a toast; Cape Town celebrated with a
                space wedding complete with a Shuttle cake; Vancouver, London, Leiden, Istanbul, Bröllin, and Dublin all
                had large dance parties; Boston put on a full day of events; and in Houston even the NASA brass showed
                up to get down.</p>

            <p>Here in LA, things went beautifully. We had the Lunar Rover parked out front, the live webcast of our
                event and our interviews with VIPs being broadcast around the world, the most kicking DJs who rocked the
                house, an awesome crowd that just loved the music and the vibe, amazing video work of our historical,
                current and fictional space footage projected on the main screen, an excellent laser system, and the
                best silver bikini clad go-go dancers in the Milky Way.</p>

            <p>After the party, young people from the LA club scene told us it was the best party they had been to and
                thanked us for creating such an awesome space. Young engineers from JPL stopped and told us it was the
                most fun they had had out in a long time. We succeeded in doing what we had set out to do – bring
                together the people who really work for space with the people who think space is cool and want to be a
                part of it.</p>
