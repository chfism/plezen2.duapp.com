</h2>
<p class="terms">As a condition of use, and the licenses granted to you herein, you agree to the
    following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Certain components of the Service permit or require you to open an account (including setting up
        a password). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        information, including your password, and for any and all activity that occurs under your
        account. You agree to notify Plezen immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or
        password, or any other breach of security. If your account is a single user account, you must
        not knowingly allow others to use your account or password.
    </li>
    <li>You must not use the Service to harass, threaten, impersonate, or intimidate anyone.</li>
    <li>You must not upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any content that is
        unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,
        libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise
        objectionable.
    </li>
    <li>You must not upload, post, email, transmit, publicly perform, or otherwise make available any
        content that violates the copyright, trademark, publicity, privacy, or other rights of third
        parties. You must comply with all intellectual property and other laws applicable to your use of
        the Service.
    </li>
    <li>You must not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unsolicited or
        unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid
        schemes," "affiliate links," or any other form of solicitation.
    </li>
    <li>You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.</li>
    <li>You must not violate any laws applicable to your use of the Service (including but not limited
        to intellectual property laws).
    </li>
    <li>You must not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. If you are an
        international user, you agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and
        acceptable content.
    </li>

        suggest an affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on the part of Plezen for the topic and/or
        creator of the presentation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="terms">All Plezen accounts offer a thirty (30) day free trial. Such free trials are limited to
    one-per-user. Users must not fraudulently obtain (or attempt to obtain) additional trial periods
    beyond this single thirty (30) day term.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2 id="toc4">4. Age Restrictions on Use of the Service
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h2>
<p class="terms"><em>Users must be at least 13 years old. </em> Users must be 13 years of age or older
    to use the Service. By using the Service you represent that you are 13 or older, and that you will
    not permit a minor under the age of 13 to use the Service, your Plezen account, or otherwise interact
    with the Service. Plezen will never knowingly solicit or accept personally identifiable information
    or other content from a user or visitor who Plezen knows is under 13 years of age. If Plezen discovers
    that a user under 13 years of age has created an account, or that a user or visitor under 13 years
    of age has posted personally identifiable information or other content to the Service, Plezen will
    terminate the account and remove the information or other content.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Users between 13 and 18 need permission from a parent or guardian.</em> Users
    between 13 and 18 years of age may utilize a Plezen account established by their parent or legal
    guardian, with such parent or guardian’s approval. If you permit your child or legal ward between 13
    and 18 years of age (“Child”) to use the Service, you hereby agree to these Terms of Use on behalf
    of both yourself and your Child. You further agree that you are solely responsible for any and all
    use of the Service by your Child regardless of whether such use was authorized by you.</p>

<h3 id="toc6.1">6.1 General
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">Plezen offers a number of ways to share, or not share, your presentation with
    others.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Plezen Public (free) Accounts</em>. If you have a Plezen Public (free) account, all
    of the content you create, including all of the information within your presentations, will be
    available to anyone who has access to the internet (“Public User Content”). Public presentations can
    be viewed by other Plezen users, will appear in the searchable Plezen database, and will be available
    for others to access and view online. Accordingly, you hereby do and shall grant to each User and to
    the public a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license to access, view and publicly perform your
    Public User Content. This license ends when you delete the presentation or your account is closed
    (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the content has been shared with others and they
    have not deleted it.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Paid Plezen Accounts</em>. If you have an educational or paid Plezen account, you can
    choose to make your content Public User Content, or Private User Content. Presentations designated
    as Private User Content, will not be available to the public. Rather, they will be available to you,
    and to those Plezen users with whom you have chosen to share the content. You may invite one or more
    people (a “Viewer”) to view your presentation by sending them a “share” link. You can learn more
    about sharing <a href="https://Plezen.zendesk.com/entries/22439286">here</a>. You hereby do and shall
    grant to each Invited Viewer a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license to access, view and
    publicly perform your Private User Content. This license ends when you delete the presentation or
    your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the content has been
    shared with others and they have not deleted it.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Sharing with edit rights</em>. Regardless of whether your presentation has been
    designated Public User Content or Private User Content, you may choose to share a presentation in a
    manner that allows the person you’ve shared the presentation with (a “Co-editor”) to edit that
    presentation. You can learn more about sharing with edit rights <a
            href="https://Plezen.zendesk.com/entries/22439286">here</a>. You hereby do and shall grant to
    each Co-editor a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license to use, store, reproduce, modify,
    create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and
    transmit the content of which they are Co-editors. This license ends when you delete the content or
    your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the content has been
    shared with the Co-editors and they have not deleted it.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Allowing Re-use</em>. If you designate your content as Public User Content, you may
    choose to “allow re-use” of that content. When you allow re-use of your Public User Content, you
    hereby do and shall grant to each user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license
    to use, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform,
    publicly display, distribute and transmit your content. This license ends when you delete the
    presentation or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the
    content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it. The “allow reuse” option is
    enabled by default for Plezen Public users when creating new Plezen presentations but can be disabled
    at any time.</p>

<h3 id="toc6.2">6.2 Licenses you grant to Plezen for use of Public User Content and Private User Content
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">In order to provide the Service to you in accordance with these terms, we need certain
    licenses from you in order for us to, e.g., host, store and display the content. For example, we
    need the right to publicly display/perform the work to allow us to display it on the computer
    monitor of any party who is not the copyright holder. We need the right to reproduce the content so
    that it can be saved to our servers. We need to create derivative works and modify the content, for
    example, when transcoding an uploaded image into a format that will work most efficiently with the
    Service.</p>

<p class="terms">With respect to Private User Content, you hereby do and shall grant to Plezen (and its
    successors, assigns, and third party service providers) a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable,
    royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce,
    modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display,
    distribute and transmit the content SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE of providing you, and those with whom you
    have shared your presentations, with the Service. This license ends when you delete your Private
    User Content or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except (i) to the extent that your
    Private User Content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it and (ii) that we
    retain a license to maintain a back-up copy of your Private User Content indefinitely.</p>

<p class="terms">With respect to Public User Content, you hereby do and shall grant to Plezen (and its
    successors, assigns, and third party service providers) a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable,
    royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce,
    modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display,
    distribute and transmit the content (1) for the purpose of providing you, and those with whom you
    have shared your presentations (including the public), with the Service; and (2) in connection with
    promotion and marketing of Plezen products and services, including without limitation allowing third
    parties to search or index the content, in connection with email promotions, product demonstrations,
    and the like. This license ends when you delete your Public User Content or your account is closed
    (either by you or by us), except (i) to the extent that your Public User Content has been shared
    with others and they have not deleted it and (ii) that we retain a license to maintain a back-up
    copy of your Public User Content indefinitely.</p>

<p class="terms">Regardless of whether you designate content public or private, Plezen makes no claim of
    ownership to your User Content, and obtains no rights to your content other than as provided for
    herein.</p>

<h3 id="toc6.3">6.3 Expiration and revocability of licenses
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">Plezen makes it easy for users with qualified accounts to change a presentation’s
    public/private, and “allow reuse” status at any time.</p>

<p class="terms">However, uses made of your presentation or the underlying User Content, whether by
    Plezen or its users, are subject to the licenses that were in place at the time such use was
    originally made by the person or entity who originally made the use. For example, licensed uses of
    Public User Content, or content that allows reuse, may continue to be made after such content is
    designated Private User Content, by those users who previously used the content under the prior
    license.</p>

<h3 id="toc6.4">6.4 Third-Party Content
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">Plezen gives you the option, when creating or editing a presentation, to search for and
    insert third party content, such as images, into your presentation. Such third party content is
    subject to certain license terms. For example, if you use an image that is licensed pursuant to a
    Creative Commons license that prohibits commercial use, you may not use the image for commercial
    purposes. Some license terms may limit the manner in which you are permitted to share content with
    others, or to allow re-use of a presentation. You agree to review and comply with the license terms
    applicable to any third party content in a presentation.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2 id="toc7">7 Payment Terms
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h2>
<p class="terms">You agree to pay the then-current fee for the account type (e.g., Public, Enjoy, Pro,
    or the like) you have selected. The current fee for the account type you have selected will
    automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date your free
    trial expires. Fees charged for one account type may not be credited towards other account types.
    All currency references are in U.S. dollars.</p>

<h3 id="toc7.1">7.1 Payment for Subscription
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">You agree to pay the then-current fee for the account type (e.g., Public, Enjoy, Pro,
    or the like) you have selected. The current fee for the account type you have selected will
    automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date your free
    trial expires. Fees charged for one account type may not be credited towards other account types.
    All currency references are in U.S. dollars.</p>

<h3 id="toc7.2">7.2 Fraud Protections
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">To protect against potential fraud, Plezen may take steps to verify the validity of the
    credit card information you provide to us. The verification process may include debiting an amount
    between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount
    back to your credit card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm
    that you are in possession of your credit card. Plezen will only use this process to screen for fraud
    and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted
    through your account for the Service. By providing Plezen with your credit card information, you
    authorize Plezen to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one dollar for
    such verification purposes.</p>

<h3 id="toc7.3">7.3 Cancellation of Subscription
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">Payment for subscriptions is non-refundable. If you cancel your reoccurring payment
    option, your account will remain active until its next renewal date. If you delete your account
    before the end of the term for which you paid, your cancellation will take effect immediately. In
    either case (cancellation or deletion), you will not be given any refund.</p>

<h3 id="toc7.4">7.4 Termination
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h3>
<p class="terms">If your credit card is invalid for any reason, your paid Plezen account will revert to a
    Plezen Public account and will be subject to the limitations of a free Plezen Public account;
    provided, however, that Plezen reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case. You
    will have the option of deleting any User Content from your account prior to its reversion to a
    Plezen Public account. Plezen further reserves the right to cancel, or revert to a Plezen Public
    account status, the account of any user who attempts to fraudulently obtain Plezen educational
    pricing.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2 id="toc8">8. Intellectual property infringement, warranties
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h2>
<p class="terms">If you believe that Plezen, or any user of the Service, has violated a copyright,
    trademark or other right you claim in your work, please contact us pursuant to the U.S. Digital
    Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) at copyright@Plezen.com and review our <a href="/copyright/">copyright
        policy</a> for more details on how to properly notify us of a DMCA issue.</p>

<p class="terms">When you upload User Content on or through the Service, you represent and warrant that,
    with respect to all User Content that you upload, transmit, publish and disseminate through the
    Service, (a) you have all the rights and licenses necessary to use, reproduce, publish, display
    publicly, perform publicly, distribute, or otherwise exploit such User Content in connection with
    the Service (and to grant to Plezen the licenses set forth in this Agreement); (b) the User Content
    will not infringe or otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property
    rights of any third party; and (c) you have the consent, release, and/or permission of each
    identifiable person depicted in your User Content to upload, transmit, publish, and/or disseminate
    their name and/or likeness through the Service.</p>

<hr class="separator">
<h2 id="toc16">16. General Terms
    <small class="pull-right back-top"><a href="#toc">back to top</a></small>
</h2>
<p class="terms"><em>Entire Agreement</em>. This Agreement is the whole legal agreement between you and
    Plezen. It governs your use of the Service and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
    and Plezen with respect to the Service. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions
    that may apply when you use or purchase other products or services from Plezen.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Governing Law</em>. The laws of the state of California, excluding California’s
    conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the
    Plezen Service.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Dispute Resolution</em>. Any dispute arising out of or relating to these terms or
    the Plezen Service shall be submitted exclusively to confidential binding arbitration in San
    Francisco, California, except that to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to
    violate Plezen’s intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in
    any state or federal court in the State of California. You hereby consent to, and waive all defenses
    of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in
    the state and federal courts of California. Arbitration under these Terms of Use shall be conducted
    pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the American Arbitration
    Association. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in
    any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
    arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject
    to this Agreement, whether through class action proceedings or otherwise.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Statute of Limitations</em>. You agree that regardless of any statue or law to the
    contrary, any claim under this Agreement must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of
    action arises, or such claim or cause of action is forever barred.</p>

<p class="terms"><em>Severability of Terms; Non-waiver of Terms; Assignment</em>. If any portion of the
    Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be stricken and the remainder
    of the Agreement enforced as written. If Plezen does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
    remedy including those contained in the Agreement or arising under applicable law, this will not be
    taken to be a formal waiver of our rights. Plezen may assign or delegate some or all of its rights
    and obligations under this Agreement.</p>
