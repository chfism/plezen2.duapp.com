<h2>1. Agreement and Parties</h2>

<p> Plezen Inc. ("Plezen," "us," or "we") respects the privacy and personal information of the members of
    the Plezen community. This privacy policy applies to information we receive when you use the Plezen
    website or Plezen software (collectively, the "Plezen Service" or "Service"). This privacy policy
    ("privacy policy" or "policy") is an agreement between Plezen and you, as the user of the Plezen
    Service ("you"). This agreement tells you when this policy is effective, how we may change this
    policy, what information we collect from you, how we might use that information, how you can review
    or change the personal information you provided to us, and the steps we take to ensure that your
    personal information is protected. We share your personal information only with your consent or as
    described in this policy. </p>

<p> Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how Plezen treats personally identifiable
    information. We follow principles that are supported by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Fair
    Information Practices Principles, currently available at <a
            href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm"
            title="Fair Information Practice Principles">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm</a>.
    If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact
    us at the email and/or mailing address provided at the end of this policy. </p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2> 2. Agreement to Terms of Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>

<p> Any Plezen Service you wish to use is purely voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal
    information to us unless you choose to access features of the Service which require such
    information. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy or other <a href="/terms-of-use">terms
        of use</a> related to the Plezen Service, then please do not provide us with personal
    information, exit this website immediately, and discontinue using the site or any component of the
    Service. Plezen's <a href="/terms-of-use">terms of use</a>, and your end user license agreement
    related to any software provided by Plezen that you download and install, are expressly incorporated
    into this policy by reference and made a part of this policy. By using the Plezen Service, you
    signify that you agree to the terms of this privacy policy as well as to our <a
            href="/terms-of-use">terms of use</a>. </p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2> 3. Effective Date Of And Changes To Privacy Policy </h2>

<p> This privacy policy is effective as of January 24th 2010, and will remain in effect except with
    respect to any of its provisions that are changed in the future, in which case the changes will
    become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted to the website or we otherwise notify you of
    the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the policy in effect at the time such
    information was collected. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time and you
    should check this privacy policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any
    such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified policy and your agreement to
    abide and be bound by the modified policy. We will also revise the "last updated" date found at the
    beginning of this privacy policy when we post changes to it. </p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2> 4. Policy Applicable To Online Activities Only </h2>

<p> The privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the internet,
    and therefore beyond Plezen's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable
    law or governmental regulation. This privacy policy only applies to information collected through
    the Plezen Service and otherwise as described in this policy. </p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2> 5 Personal Information About You </h2>

<h3> 5.1 Types Of Information Collected </h3>

<p> We may ask you for certain information, referred to as "personal information," which includes
    information that pertains to your identity. Such information may include, but is not limited to,
    items such as your name, email address, and credit card billing information. </p>

<h3>5.2 Personal Information You Provide to Us </h3>

<p>You may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts or features of the
    Plezen Service. For example, you will be asked to provide your name and a valid email address to
    establish an account at <a href="http://Plezen.com">http://Plezen.com</a>. If you wish to establish a
    paid Plezen account, you will also be asked (in some cases) to provide credit card account and
    billing information. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may not be able
    to access or use the particular component of the Service where such information is required.</p>

<h3>5.3 Survey Information </h3>

<p>From time to time, Plezen may ask its registered users to participate in surveys. These surveys are
    purely optional and help us improve the Plezen Service and provide aggregate information which we
    think may interest our registered users and visitors. We may use the information that you
    voluntarily provide as part of your survey response in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy.
    In addition, if you choose to participate in a Plezen survey, any information you provide to us,
    including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system and to any personal
    information contained therein. We may also use the information you provide in the aggregate to help
    us generate statistics regarding use of the Plezen Service. For example, if you reveal in a survey
    response that you are a teacher, Plezen will know that you are a teacher, will retain that
    information in association with your registered user account, and may publish aggregate statistics
    based thereon (for example, statistics regarding what portion of our educational users are teachers
    versus what portion of our educational users are students). If you would not like your information
    to be used in this way, please do not participate in Plezen surveys or, if participating, please
    provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy
    Policy.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>6. Personal Information You Provide About Others</h2>

<p>Some components of the Plezen Service allow you to share content and personal messages you upload with
    others by generating messages directly to those other individuals. To use this feature, we require
    you provide us with a valid email address for each recipient. Plezen uses these email addresses only
    to share your content and personal messages (at your direction). We use this information for the
    sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store it after this one-time email is sent.
    This one-time email may also contain a short description and explanation of the Plezen Service.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>7. General Information We May Collect</h2>

<h3>7.1 Types Of Information Collected </h3>

<p>There may be other instances in which we collect information from you that is more general in nature
    ("general information"). Such information may include information recorded by our server logs from
    your browser such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which enables us to identify your computer
    or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network like the internet),
    and the specific webpage you requested. Such general information, including the click stream data
    and cookies, as mentioned below, may be collected from you whenever you access or use the Plezen
    Service, whether or not you provide us with any other personal information.</p>

<h3>7.2 Click Stream Data</h3>

<p>When you use the Plezen Service we may collect "click stream data" (server address, domain name,
    etc.). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us, which will enable
    us to analyze and better customize your visits. We may use click stream data for traffic analysis or
    e-commerce analysis of our services, to determine which features within the Plezen Service are most
    or least effective or useful to you.</p>

<h3>7.3 Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small string of information that the website you visit transfers to your computer for
    identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your activity throughout the Plezen Service
    and that information helps us to understand your preferences and improve your experience. Plezen
    cookies do not collect personal information from you, and we do not combine the general information
    collected through cookies with other personal information you may provide to personally identify
    you. You can turn off all cookies, if you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your
    computer warn you whenever cookies are being used. Please refer to documentation provider with your
    web browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Internet Explorer) for information on enabling these
    options. There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you. Please be
    aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the functionality of
    the website and you may lose access to some of its features.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2> 8. Use and Sharing of Information </h2>

<h3>8.1 To Provide Products And Services To You</h3>

<p>We will use the personal information you provide and any general information we receive from you to
    provide Plezen products and services to you, which include the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li> To process orders you may place at http://Plezen.com.</li>
    <li> To assist those who help us in designing and operating the Plezen Service or help us analyze
        collected data. These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work
        as agreed with us and will be required to keep the information confidential.
    </li>
    <li> To send you information or materials via email about products, offers, and news we think might
        interest you. This information may relate to products, offers, and news of Plezen or its
        licensees or selected commercial partners. (If you no longer wish to receive any emails from us,
        or if you want to modify your personal data or want your personal data to be deleted from our
        database, please see "CANCELING YOUR ACCOUNT, OPTING OUT OF EMAIL, AND MODIFYING PERSONAL
        INFORMATION" below.)
    </li>
    <li> To analyze visits to the Plezen website and learn about the interests of our visitors in the
        aggregate and also on a personal level to better understand your interests and needs, so we can
        improve our products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features, and
        promotions that you are most interested in.
    </li>
    <li> To publish aggregate statistics regarding our user base. For example, we may choose to publish
        statistics regarding how many registered Plezen users live in the U.S. versus how many live in
        Europe. If you complete a Plezen survey that asks for employment information, we may publish
        statistics regarding which professions are most likely to use or not use Plezen.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Business Transfers</h3>

<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
    information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Plezen or
    substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would likely be one of the
    assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may
    occur, and that any acquirer of Plezen may continue to use your personal information as set forth in
    this policy.</p>

<h3> 8.3 Protection of Plezen and Others </h3>

<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply
    with any law, enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and other agreements, or
    protect the rights, property, or safety of Plezen, our employees, our customers, or others. We may
    disclose personal or general information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate
    with a law enforcement investigation, which may include responding to requests and court orders from
    jurisdictions outside the United States. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies
    any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion.
</p>

<h3>8.4 With Your Consent</h3>

<p>Except as set forth herein, we will notify you or obtain your consent before your personal
    information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this
    information. Registered users may, at any time, elect to stop receiving emails from us by visiting
    the <a href="http://Plezen.com/settings/">Settings page at Plezen.com/settings</a> (requires log in).
</p>

<h3>8.5 Retention of Your Information</h3>

<p>We will only retain your information to the extent: (a) it is needed for the purposes which we have
    conveyed to you; (b) we are required by law to maintain such information; or (c) it is needed for us
    to address any issues or inquiries that you may have. When your information is no longer required,
    we will dispose of such information by destroying it or erasing it.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>9 Protection Of Your Information</h2>

<h3>9.1. Security Measures</h3>

<p>In order to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from
    you through your use of the Plezen Service, we have implemented various security measures. For
    example, when you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our online forms,
    we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also follow generally
    accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
    transmission and once we receive it.</p>

<h3>9.2. Risk Of Interception</h3>

<p>Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk
    that third parties may intercept and use that information. While Plezen strives to protect your
    personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose
    online. By using the Plezen Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the
    security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Plezen Service and that
    any personal information, general information, or other data or information received from you
    through your use of the Plezen Service is provided to us at your own risk, which you expressly
    assume.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>10. No Use Of This Service By Minors Permited</h2>

<h3>10.1. Registration Declined For Minors</h3>

<p>The Plezen Service is intended only for those who are at least 18 years old &ndash; or, if the age of
    majority in your state or province is greater than 18 years, such age of majority in your state or
    province &ndash; or who have obtained the consent of their parent or guardian to use the Plezen
    Service. Personal registration information submitted by a minor violates the website <a
            href="/terms">terms of use</a> and will not be accepted. Any general information
    provided by minor and gathered (for example, through the use of cookies) during his or her visit may
    be used as indicated in this privacy policy. Plezen is committed to protecting the privacy of
    children and has no intention of collecting personal data from minors. We encourage parents and
    guardians of minors to regularly check and monitor their children's use of email and other
    activities online.</p>

<h3>10.2. Notice Concerning Children</h3>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: The Plezen Service is general audience service, and does not direct any of its content,
    products, or services specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are
    committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. If we learn or have
    reason to suspect that a user of the Plezen Service is under age 13, we will promptly delete any
    personal information in that user's account. If you have such information, please contact us as <a
            href="mailto:legal@Plezen.com">legal@Plezen.com</a></p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>11. Links to Third Parties</h2>

<p>For your convenience and to improve the usage of the Plezen Service we may insert links to third party
    websites. This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites. These links take you
    outside our Service, and off the Plezen site, and are beyond our control. This includes links from
    partners that may use Plezen's logos as part of a co-branding agreement. The sites those links can
    take you to have their own separate privacy policy and although we seek to protect the integrity of
    our Service, Plezen is not liable for the content and activities of those sites. Your visits and
    access to such websites is at your own risk. Please note that those other sites may send their own
    cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>
<hr class="separator">
<h2>12. Canceling Your Account, Opting Out of Email, and Modifying Personal Information</h2>

<p>You may cancel your account and you may opt out of receiving any emails from Plezen at any time. You
    may cancel your account, opt out of, or modify your personal information, by logging in and visiting
    your <a href="/settings/">Settings & Account page</a> and following the instructions provided, or go
    to our <a href="/support">Help & Support page</a>. We encourage you promptly to update your personal
    information when it changes. Information concerning your past behavior with the Service may be
    retained indefinitely by Plezen.</p>

<p>Please note that although you may opt out of receiving certain emails, Plezen reserves the right to
    communicate with you via email regarding specific products and services you have ordered, requested,
    or inquired about.</p>
